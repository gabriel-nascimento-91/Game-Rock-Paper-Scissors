# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a rock, paper, scissors game developed with HTML5, CSS3 and JS based on the tutorial by whatsdev on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube page.

### The standard tutorial includes:
1. Score counter;
2. Buttons animations;
3. Choice identifier for the User and the Computer.

*I added extra functions so that instead of the text being "Rock beats Scissors", "Scissors beats Paper", ... it displays "Rock crushes Scissors", "Scissors cuts Paper", ...
